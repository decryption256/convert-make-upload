# convert-make-upload
Takes a directory of uncompressed TIFF files and turns them into a single PDF with lossless JPEG2000 images, then archives and compresses the TIFF files for cold storage.

Will add uploading the PDF to the Internet Archive and the archive of raw TIFF files to super cheap online storage (Amazon Glacier or something like that).
